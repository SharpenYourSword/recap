Reporting Issues
================

This repository is a centralized place for filing [issues](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap/issues) on any [RECAP](http://recapthelaw.org)-related effort. When you file an issue, please search to make sure no one else has already reported that issue. If you open a new issue, please use labels to indicate which component(s) are affected (firefox, chrome, affects all browsers, server, etc.) and whether you are reporting a "bug" or requesting an "enhancement."

Contributing
============
If you'd like to help with development work, here's a brief overview:

Each browser extension has its own repo:
* [recap-chrome](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-chrome)
* [recap-firefox](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-firefox)
* [recap-ie](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-ie) (Incomplete; help-wanted)

The RECAP server has its own repo:
* [recap-server](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-server)

Attempts have been made to make a cross-platform extension that would work on many browsers.
None of these are fully-functional:
* [recap-openforge](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-openforge) (Incomplete; help-wanted)
* [recap-extension-2.0](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-extension-2.0) (Incomplete; help-wanted)
